# Visualizing survival curves

```{r, include =FALSE}
library(survival)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)


```


Let's first look at our little survival data (to see how this works) and then we will look at the actual data.  \

The following code creates the data:

```{r little data}

simple=data.frame(matrix(c(7,8,10,3,2,3,1,1,0,1,1,0),ncol=2))
colnames(simple)=c("tenure","censored")
simple

```


To calculate the survival probabilities, we will use the survfit command.

```{r survival probabilities}

simple_km=survfit(Surv(tenure, censored==1)~1,                      data = simple)
summary(simple_km)

```
